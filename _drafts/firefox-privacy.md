## Setting up Firefox for privacy

Taking back control of my personal data as best as I can. Too much unknown.

Here's how to setup Firefox on your desktop on or Android to better ensure your privacy.

### Firefox on the desktop



* Custom Tracking Protection
* `about:config` privacy settings, https://wiki.mozilla.org/Privacy/Privacy_Task_Force/firefox_about_config_privacy_tweeks
* uBlock Origin
* DNS over HTTPS, `network.trr.mode` set to _3_

### Firefox on Android

* Use [Firefox Preview for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix).
* Configure Private DNS.
