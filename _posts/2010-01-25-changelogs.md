# Changelogs

I kinda like changelogs, they keep a tidy record of what you’ve done to something. I have one running at isitup, a helpful reminder sometimes (though I think I should have added dates/times to it…).

In a way this site is one, but in a broader sense.

_Edit_ – I found a nice [guide to changelogs](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html) while doing a quick search, it’s on the GNU site and looks helpful.
