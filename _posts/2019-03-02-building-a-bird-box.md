## Building a Bird Box

Today I built a bird box over in [Blackhorse Workshop](http://www.blackhorseworkshop.co.uk) with a friend from work.

What else are you going to do at nine-ish on a Saturday morning… 🤦‍♂️

We followed [a guide published by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds](https://www.rspb.org.uk/helping-nature/what-you-can-do/activities/build-a-birdbox). Lee was particularly keen on building them to suit a [Blue Tit](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/blue-tit).

Here’s a few photos from the morning.

They came out far from perfect, but I don’t think any bird is going to complain. We figured we’d try our hand at making one again in six months to see if our woodworking’s actually improving.
