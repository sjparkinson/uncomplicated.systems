title: Hello World!
---

I've found myself publishing across several diffrent platforms lately, [Medium](https://medium.com/@samparkinson_), [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/sjparkinson), [GitBook](https://bhx8e2n0dha1.gitbook.io/docker-101/), and probabily a few other places too.

To simplify, what I've actually done is create yet another platform for me to publish my notes on.

So hello world, welcome to [uncomplicated systems](https://uncomplicated.systems)!
