title: Hello World!
---

I've found myself publishing across several diffrent platforms lately, [Medium](https://medium.com/@samparkinson_), [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/sjparkinson), [GitBook](https://bhx8e2n0dha1.gitbook.io/docker-101/), and probabily a few other places too.

To simplify, what I've actually done is create yet another platform for me to publish my notes on. Hopefully over time this will better suit my needs.

So hello world! Welcome to [uncomplicated systems](https://uncomplicated.systems).
