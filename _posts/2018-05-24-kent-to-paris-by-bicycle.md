### Updates

#### Saturday Morning ‚Äî Kent to Folkestone

It's Saturday morning and I'm in Kent, mostly ready to go.

There are 13 riders in total, and 14 bikes just in case.

First up is a ride to the tunnel, should take a handful of hours. From there we pack everything in a van and cross the channel.

We made it to Tesco Folkestone, time for some pain au chocolate!

#### Saturday Afternoon ‚Äî Calais to Somewhere in France
