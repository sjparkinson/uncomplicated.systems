I've just signed up to a last minute charity ride in support of the [Motor Neurone Disease Association](https://www.mndassociation.org).

There's a group of us spending the long weekend cycling from Kent to Paris 🥐.

It's a ~250 mile cycle over three days, and I've just checked the weather, it's looking _very_ interesting ⛈️ ...

### Updates

#### Saturday Morning — Kent to Folkestone

It's Saturday morning and I'm in Kent, mostly ready to go.

There are 13 riders in total, and 14 bikes just in case.

First up is a ride to the tunnel, should take a handful of hours. From there we pack everything in a van and cross the channel.

We made it to Tesco in Folkestone, time for some pain au chocolate!

#### Saturday Afternoon — Calais to Somewhere in France

Just queuing for the train. So far the weather has been absolutely amazing 🌤️.

And out the other side. Hello France 🇫🇷! Time for a 67km ride to our destination.

It's ~5:30pm French time and we're doing a quick water run in a nice town called La Capelle-lès-Boulogne. 20km down, quite a chunk to go! Looking forward to a nice cold beer at the end of todays ride 🍺.

Just been through a wonderful forest, called the Boulogne Forest. A couple of nice climbs and beautiful scenery 🌲.
