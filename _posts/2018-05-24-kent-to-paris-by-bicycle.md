I've just signed up to a last minute charity ride in support of the [Motor Neurone Disease Association](https://www.mndassociation.org).

There's a group of us spending the long weekend cycling from Kent to Paris ü•ê.

It's a ~250 mile cycle over three days, and I've just checked the weather, it's looking _very_ interesting...
