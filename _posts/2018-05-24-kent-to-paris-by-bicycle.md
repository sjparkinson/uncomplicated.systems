I've just signed up to a last minute charity ride in support of the [Motor Neurone Disease Association](https://www.mndassociation.org).

There's a group of us spending the long weekend cycling from Kent to Paris 🥐.

It's a ~250 mile cycle over three days, and I've just checked the weather, it's looking _very_ interesting ⛈️ ...

### Updates

#### Saturday Morning — Kent to Folkestone

It's Saturday morning and I'm in Kent, mostly ready to go.

There are 13 riders in total, and 14 bikes just in case.

First up is a ride to the tunnel, should take us a handful of hours. From there we pack everything in a van and cross the channel.

We made it to Tesco in Folkestone, time for some pain au chocolate!

#### Saturday Afternoon — Calais to Somewhere on the Coast of France

Just queuing for the train. So far the weather has been absolutely amazing 🌤️.

And out the other side. Hello France 🇫🇷! Time for a 67km ride to our destination.

It's ~5:30pm French time and we're doing a quick water run in a nice town called La Capelle-lès-Boulogne. 20km down, quite a chunk to go! Looking forward to a nice cold beer at the end of todays ride 🍺.

We've just been through the wonderful Boulogne Forest. A couple of nice climbs and beautiful scenery 🌲, 36km down for this second leg. 

It was a cracking flat 10km ride down to Le Touquet on the French coast.

That wraps up the day, with 116km sent 🚴. Great weather all day, and an awesome hotel to finish.

#### Sunday Morning — Le Touquet to Château de Rambures

Aiming for a 7:30am start today. Weather isn't looking quite as good as yesterday, sunny start converting to thunderstorms in the afternoon...

There's a 150km to get through today, a bit more than yesterday. Google's saying it should be about 8h on the saddle 🤣.

#### Sunday Afternoon — Château de Rambures to Beauvais

Also coming soon™️
