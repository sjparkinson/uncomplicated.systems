I've just signed up to a last minute charity ride in support of the [Motor Neurone Disease Association](https://www.mndassociation.org).

There's a group of us spending the long weekend cycling from Kent to Paris ü•ê.

[Feel free to support me on my JustGiving page](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/samuel-parkinson-paris-cycle).
