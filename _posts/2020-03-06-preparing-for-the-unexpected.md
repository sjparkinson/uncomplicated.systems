## Preparing for the Unexpected

I presented my talk at QCon London this week.

[You can find a video of the talk on InfoQ, along with a full transcription and slides.](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/ft-managing-incidents/)

There's also a few extra bits of content that I worked with the organisers to support the talk.
