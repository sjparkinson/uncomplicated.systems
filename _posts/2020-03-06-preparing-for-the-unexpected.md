## Preparing for the Unexpected

I presented my talk at QCon London this week.

You can [download a copy of the slides from QCon London's site](https://qconlondon.com/system/files/presentation-slides/samuel_parkinson_-_preparing_for_the_unexpected.pdf).

I will include a video of the talk when it is public on InfoQ.

There's also a few extra bits of content that I worked with the organisers to support the talk.
