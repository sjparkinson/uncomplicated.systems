## Hello World!

I've found myself publishing across several different platforms lately, [Medium](https://medium.com/@samparkinson_), [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/sjparkinson), and probably a few other places too.

To simplify, what I've actually done is create another platform for me to publish my notes on.
