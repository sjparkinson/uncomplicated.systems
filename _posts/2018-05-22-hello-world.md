## Hello World!

I've found myself publishing across several different platforms lately, Medium, [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/sjparkinson), and probably a few other places too.

To simplify, what I've actually done is create _another_ platform for me to publish my notes on.

So hello world, welcome to [uncomplicated systems](https://uncomplicated.systems)!
