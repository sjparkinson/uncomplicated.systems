## The "Live" Updates

### Friday ‚òÄÔ∏è ‚õàÔ∏è

6:44am, at Heathrow, way too early. I'm sat in a restaurant wondering if all the fog outside will be problematic üå´Ô∏è.

8:17am, about to board. Picked up a copy of Monocle, love the font they use, [Plantin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin_(typeface)) and created in 1913 by the Monotype Corporation.

11:59am local time, and we're landed üá©üá™, right into a 29¬∞C heatwave, with a jumper on...

12:42pm, melting like cheese in an oven üßÄ.

6:26pm, somewhere near a nice red train station, about to eat potatos ü•î. Spent the day wondering around Berlin with Kirsten. Visited the Bundestag too, amazing views.

8:18pm, from heatwave to thunderstorms, I've got no idea what to wear. In other news I can order stuff in German, but if they ask if I want a reciept my brain just shuts down ü§∑. Off to meet the rest of the troops.

12:28am, we invented the Probably Not. One part German beer, one shot whiskey, topped with a wedge of pineapple üçç.

### Saturday ‚õÖ

7:58am, super German breakfast at the hotel.

9:24am, conference is just abiut to start. Holy cow is this a big one!

10:00am, mention of frozen yogurt! Loving how creative this is ‚ô•Ô∏è.

10:27am, not many people like semicolon. The drawings from the first talk on errors were so nice.

12:48pm, learning all about how systems uniquely fingerprint browsers/users. Dark stuff.

2:29pm, off to hear about web development in China üá®üá≥.

### Sunday ‚õÖ

10:17am, survived karaoke till about 2am before everything started getting turned off. Had a pizza slice on the way back. There were a _lot_ of people who were only just starting their night about that time.

There's a couple of friends talking today, looking forward to hearing them speak.

10:31am, pay with your face at KFC China üêî...

10:43am, just witnessed Charlie on stage use her mind to control a keyboard and then navigate a 3D space, so awesome.

10:55am, Gabi's time to shine üôå.

~10:30am, what a beautiful talk, https://2018.jsconf.eu/speakers/gabrielle-von-koss-when-you-assume-you-make-an-error-out-of-you-and-me.html.

11:57am, some really interesting thoughts on our choice of vocabulary within technology by Brittany Storoz.

12:55pm, Adam's friend, Patima Tantiprasut, talking about Overtraining Syndrome. Always a healthy discussion, and learned a new phrase "hard yakka".

3:16pm, some inspiring talks and it's refreshing to hear more than just heavy tech during this conference. Time for a breather though üå§Ô∏è.

4:04pm, now for "Securing your site like it's 1999". Sounds like a riot üòÅ.

8:01pm, and that's pretty much it. Time for a party on a boat ‚õ¥Ô∏è.

### Monday üå§Ô∏è

10:35am, just about to go for brunch at Datscha Xberg to wrap up the conference. Just people watching from a caf√© nearby while the rest of the FT group meander over.
