I'm off to JSConf EU this weekend, updates to follow.

## The "Live" Updates

6:44am, at Heathrow, way too early. I'm sat in a restaurant wondering if all the fog outside will be problematic üå´Ô∏è.

8:17am, about to board. Picked up a copy of Monocle, love the font they use, it's called [Plantin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin_(typeface)) and made in 1913 by the Monotype Corporation.
