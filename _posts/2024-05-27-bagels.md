# Bagels

Work in progress at home bagel recipe. It will take about 2 and a half hours total.

## Ingredients

* 500g [very strong flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/canadian-strong-white-bread-flour) (~14g protein per 100g flour) (Canadian flour seems to be the one...)
* Yeast
* 300ml warm water (~40℃)
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp [diastatic malt flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/diastatic-malt-flour-500g-307)
* Bicarbonate of soda (baked?)

## Method

1. Mix the yest, diastatic malt flour and water. Leave to rest for 5 minutes.

2. Combine the liquid with the flour. Knead in a stand mixer using the dough hook for 10–15 minutes, [until the dough passes the windowpane test](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-the-windowpane-test-for-bread-dough).

3. Scrape out the dough, lightly oil the mixing bowl, return the dough to the bowl, cover and leave to prove for 1 hour.

4. Knock back the dough, which should have doubled in size. Divide into 8.

5. Shape the bagles, [rolling them out is best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxAV3NdW5AU), and leave to prove for a further 10 minutes.

6. Preheat the oven to 200℃. Bring a large pan of water to boil, and add the bicarbonate of soda.

7. In batches, boil the bagels for 30–60 seconds each side, then place on a baking tray.

8. Coat in your desired bagel topping, probably with "everything bagel seasoning"...

9. Cook for ~20 minutes.

10. Eat more bagels than expected over the next couple of days.
