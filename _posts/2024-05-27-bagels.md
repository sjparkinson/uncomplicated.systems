### Ingredients

* 1kg [very strong flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/canadian-strong-white-bread-flour) (~14g protein per 100g flour), you can substitute up to 200g with wholemeal or rye flour
* 2 tsp _instant_ dry yeast
* 550ml warm water
* 1 tsp fine sea salt
* 1 tsp [diastatic malt flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/diastatic-malt-flour-500g-307)
* 1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda

### Method

1. Combine the flour, yeast, diastatic malt flour and salt in a stand mixer (use the dough hook attachment).

1. Add the warm water and knead for 10–20 minutes, or as soon as [the dough passes the windowpane test](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-the-windowpane-test-for-bread-dough).

3. Remove and cover the bowl, leave it to prove for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.

4. Knock back the dough and divide it into 12 dough balls.

5. Shape the bagels, [rolling them out is best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxAV3NdW5AU).

6. Leave the bagels to prove for a further 15–20 minutes on a silicone mat, dust with semolina flour and cover gently with cling film.

7. Preheat the oven to 220°C or as hot as it goes.

8. Bring a large pan of water mixed with the bicarbonate of soda to a rolling boil.

9. In batches, boil the bagels for 30 seconds each side, then place on a baking tray.

10. (Optional) Coat in your desired bagel topping, probably with [everything bagel seasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_bagel)!

11. Bake for 20 minutes, placing bagels with toppings at the bottom of the oven to stop the toppings from burning.

12. Eat more bagels than expected over the next couple of days.

These bagels freeze _really_ well. We just chuck them in the freezer as they are. Microwave for 1 minute from frozen and it is almost like they are fresh out of the oven.
