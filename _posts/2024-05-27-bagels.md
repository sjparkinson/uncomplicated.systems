## Ingredients

* 500g [very strong flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/canadian-strong-white-bread-flour) (~14g protein per 100g flour)
* Yeast
* 300ml warm water (40℃±2℃)
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp [diastatic malt flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/diastatic-malt-flour-500g-307)
* 1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda

## Method

1. Mix the yeast, diastatic malt flour and water. Leave to rest for 5 minutes.

2. Combine the flour and salt in a stand mixer then add the liquid. Knead using the dough hook for 15 minutes, [until the dough passes the windowpane test](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-the-windowpane-test-for-bread-dough).

3. Remove the dough hook, cover the bowl and leave it to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.

4. Knock back the dough. Divide into 8.

5. Shape the bagels, [rolling them out is best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxAV3NdW5AU), and leave to prove for a further 10 minutes.

6. Preheat the oven to 220℃. Bring a large pan of water to boil, and add the bicarbonate of soda.

7. In batches, boil the bagels for 30 seconds each side, then place on a baking tray.

8. Coat in your desired bagel topping, probably with [everything bagel seasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_bagel)!

9. Cook for 20 minutes. Add a bit of water to the bottom of the oven when the bagels go in, to stop the topping from burning.

10. Eat more bagels than expected over the next couple of days.
