## Ingredients

* 1kg [very strong flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/canadian-strong-white-bread-flour) (~14g protein per 100g flour)
* 2 tsp instant dry yeast
* 480ml warm water (40℃±2℃)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp [diastatic malt flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/diastatic-malt-flour-500g-307)
* 1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda

## Method

1. Mix the yeast, diastatic malt flour and water. Leave to rest for 5 minutes.

2. Combine the flour and salt in a stand mixer then add the liquid. Knead using the dough hook for 20 minutes, [until the dough passes the windowpane test](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-the-windowpane-test-for-bread-dough).

3. Remove the dough hook, cover the bowl and leave it to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.

4. Knock back the dough and divide it into 12.

5. Shape the bagels, [rolling them out is best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxAV3NdW5AU).

6. Leave the bagels to prove for a further 10 minutes on a flour dusted surface.

7. Preheat the oven to 220℃. Bring a large pan of water mixed with the bicarbonate of soda to a rolling boil.

8. In batches, boil the bagels for 30 seconds each side, then place on a baking tray.

9. Coat in your desired bagel topping, probably with [everything bagel seasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_bagel)!

10. Cook for 20 minutes. Add a bit of water to the bottom of the oven when the bagels go in, to stop the toppings from burning.

11. Eat more bagels than expected over the next couple of days.
