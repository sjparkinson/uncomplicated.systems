## Ingredients

* 500g [very strong flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/canadian-strong-white-bread-flour) (~14g protein per 100g flour)
* Yeast
* 300ml warm water (~40℃)
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp [diastatic malt flour](https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/diastatic-malt-flour-500g-307)
* 1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda

## Method

1. Mix the yest, diastatic malt flour and water. Leave to rest for 5 minutes.

2. Combine the liquid with the flour and salt. Knead in a stand mixer using the dough hook for 15 minutes, [until the dough passes the windowpane test](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-the-windowpane-test-for-bread-dough).

3. Scrape out the dough, lightly oil the mixing bowl, return the dough to the bowl, cover and leave to prove for 1 hour.

4. Knock back the dough, which should have doubled in size. Divide into 8.

5. Shape the bagels, [rolling them out is best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxAV3NdW5AU), and leave to prove for a further 10 minutes.

6. Preheat the oven to 200℃. Bring a large pan of water to boil, and add the bicarbonate of soda.

7. In batches, boil the bagels for 30 seconds each side, then place on a baking tray.

8. Coat in your desired bagel topping, probably with [everything bagel seasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_bagel)!

9. Cook for ~20 minutes. Add a bit of water to the bottom of the oven when the bagels go in, to stop the topping from burning.

10. Eat more bagels than expected over the next couple of days.
