## QCon London in 2020

I'm going to be speaking at this years [QCon London](https://qconlondon.com)! Super exciting and nerve racking all at the same time as it'll be my first time presenting at a confrence.

The talk right now is titled ["Preparing for the Unexpected"](https://qconlondon.com/london2020/presentation/chaos-and-resilience-presentation-0) and will cover the journey we went through at the FT in 2019 to encoruage more developers to join the out of hours support team.
