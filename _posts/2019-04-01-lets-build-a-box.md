title: "Let's build a box!"

I've joined a course run by Blackhorse Workshop to learn the basics of joinery and powertools.

It's spread neatly over five Tuesday evenings. The plan is to build an open fronted box.

### Lesson One

So far we've learnt how to use a drill (really starting with the basics), and a router. Now I finally know what the numbers are on the ring around the drill, touque settings for screws!

We started the first evening by learning how to join two bits of wood togther using screws. Simple, but does the job!
