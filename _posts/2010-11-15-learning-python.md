# Learning Python

As I’ve recently started my Computer Science course I’ve had to start learning a few new programming languages. One of these is Python, famously used by Google amongst others. It’s a great language, and very similar to PHP which I’ve already been using for a while.

Being a redditor I’m subscribed to the great programming sub-reddit, to which someone posted a great tutorial on learning Python.

Called "[Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)" (which used to be free!) it starts from the very basics and has a very practical approach to learning the language with 52 exercises in total to go through.
