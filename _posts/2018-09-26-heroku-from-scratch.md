> ℹ️ This post is for an internal workshop at the Financial Times.

We're going to put togther a Heroku application, from scratch.

We'll use the Heroku CLI, Node.js, and the express web framework.

1. [Heroku – Getting Started with Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)

2. [Heroku – Preparing a Codebase for Heroku Deployment](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/preparing-a-codebase-for-heroku-deployment)

3. [Express – Hello World](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)

If we begin by building a basic hello world application using Express locally, we can then prepare the code for deployment to Heroku, then finally create the app and ship it ⛴.
