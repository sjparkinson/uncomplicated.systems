# Uncomplicated Systems

This is a minimal Jekyll based website I'm using to publish content on the internet.

It's based off the [GitHub Pages Cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman), and I've simplified it to better suit a blog format.

There are also several accessibility and performance improvements I've added.
